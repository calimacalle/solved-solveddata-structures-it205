1. Write code for creating a linked list, adding elements to the linked listat the tail, searching for an element with a particular key and alsodeleting an element with a particular key if it exists.2. Write a code for implementing a stack, a queue, and a queue simulatedby two stacks and a stack simulated by two queues, all using prespec-ified size arrays. You need to implement the push, pop, enqueue,dequeue operations and error checks.3. Implement stacks and queues using the linked list data-structure.4. Write code for reversing a singly linked list.5. (a) Implement routines for exchanging two elements of a stack. Youmay use two extra stacks for temporary storage.(b) Implement a routine for reversing a contiguous subsequence of astack of elements. Again you may use two auxilliary stacks fortemporary storage.(c) Write a routine for exchanging two elements of a queue using twoextra queues for temporary storage.(d) Write routine for reversing a subsequence of contiguous elementsof a queue, using two auxilliary queues.
